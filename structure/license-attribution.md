# License And Attribution Strategy

## Current State

The imported source currently includes an MIT `LICENSE` file with:

```text
Copyright (c) 2020 Weijan Chen
```

The current README also credits:

- cweijan / original `vscode-office`
- RJ.Wang / maintained fork of `cweijan/vscode-office`
- Vanessa219 / Vditor
- PDF.js, docxjs, SheetJS, x-spreadsheet, Rest Client, Mermaid

The public docs keep `LICENSE`, `NOTICE.md`, and localized READMEs aligned so
the product is not visually branded as a GitHub fork while attribution remains
visible.

## Policy

새 GitHub repository로 가더라도 원본이 MIT이면 코드 복사, 수정, 배포 자체는 가능하지만 copyright notice, permission notice, disclaimer를 보존해야 합니다.

> 출처: [MIT Copyright Notice](https://web.mit.edu/ivlib/www/copyright.html)
> 출처: [rjwang1982/vscode-office](https://github.com/rjwang1982/vscode-office)
> 출처: [cweijan/vscode-office](https://github.com/cweijan/vscode-office)

## Recommended Files

The active attribution and branding surface is:

```text
LICENSE
NOTICE.md
README.md
README-CN.md
README-KO.md
package.json
docs/index.html
images/logo-new.svg
images/logo-new.png
```

Current `NOTICE.md` outline:

```text
vscode_obsdian

This project contains code derived from:
- cweijan/vscode-office
- rjwang1982/vscode-office, a maintained fork of cweijan/vscode-office

The original code is licensed under the MIT License.
Original copyright notices are preserved in LICENSE and source files.

Additional bundled third-party components include:
- Vditor
- pdf.js
- docx-preview/docxjs
- SheetJS/xlsx
- x-spreadsheet
- Mermaid
- Rest Client-derived HTTP tooling
- rhwp / rhwp-studio
- bundled Korean web fonts used by rhwp-studio
```

## Logo Attribution

The current logo was created for this repository on 2026-05-29. Source chain:

```text
OpenAI image generation concept
  -> manual vector simplification in images/logo-new.svg
  -> rendered package icon in images/logo-new.png
  -> copied GitHub Pages asset in docs/assets/logo-new.png
```

The design intent is a faceted obsidian document core with layered sheets,
cyan/jade ribbons, and abstract document-format accents. It must remain
visually distinct from:

- the Obsidian app logo;
- the VS Code logo;
- Microsoft Office icons;
- Hancom branding;
- cweijan/vscode-office artwork;
- rjwang1982/vscode-office artwork;
- the previous green folder / "E" vscode-office-enhanced logo.

Do not restore the old upstream logo comments or author attribution in
`images/logo-new.svg`; that asset is no longer the active logo source.

## HWP Runtime Attribution

HWP/HWPX editing uses a local build of `edwardkim/rhwp`.

Release notice facts:

```text
Upstream: https://github.com/edwardkim/rhwp
Pinned tag: v0.7.13
Pinned commit: b3e16ef212af81ef37d973ddb86d6816d3804642
Runtime source in repo: vendor/rhwp-studio-dist
Runtime package path: resource/rhwp-studio
```

The extension must not imply affiliation with Hancom or rhwp upstream. Use
"powered by a bundled local rhwp-studio runtime" rather than "official HWP
editor" or "Hancom replacement".

## Font Attribution

The rhwp-studio runtime includes Korean web fonts documented in
`vendor/rhwp-studio-dist/fonts/FONTS.md`. Public notices should mention that:

- proprietary Hancom and Microsoft fonts are not bundled;
- open/free-distribution fallback fonts are bundled for layout compatibility;
- release artifacts must preserve bundled font license files.

Known bundled font families include Noto Sans KR, Noto Serif KR, Nanum,
Pretendard, Gowun, D2 Coding, Spoqa Han Sans, Cafe24 fonts, and Happiness Sans.

## README Language

Allowed:

```text
vscode_obsdian is based on MIT-licensed vscode-office code. Original copyright and license notices are preserved.

Original lineage:
- cweijan/vscode-office
- rjwang1982/vscode-office, maintained fork of cweijan/vscode-office
```

Avoid:

```text
Forked project
Official continuation
Original author maintained
```

Reason: the product should not visually brand itself as a GitHub fork, but the legal provenance should remain visible.

## Package Metadata

Current release metadata has been updated:

- `name`
- `displayName`
- `description`
- `publisher`
- `repository` points to `https://github.com/lidge-jun/vscode_obsdian.git`
- `homepage` points to `https://lidge-jun.github.io/vscode_obsdian/`
- `bugs` points to `https://github.com/lidge-jun/vscode_obsdian/issues`
- `keywords`
- configuration title

Future compatibility migration should separately decide:

- command category labels
- configuration prefix
- custom viewType IDs

Do not use placeholder repository URLs. The current metadata uses the real new repository URL and must not point back to either upstream source.

## Current Release Decisions

1. Public package name is `vscode-obsdian`; display name remains `vscode_obsdian`.
2. Publisher ID is `jun6161` in `package.json`.
3. Runtime `vscode-office.*` settings and `cweijan.*` viewTypes are intentionally retained as legacy compatibility surfaces until a separate migration/alias decision exists.
4. `README-CN.md` is retained and rewritten for now.
