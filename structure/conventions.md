# Conventions

## Current Observed Conventions

이 프로젝트는 기존 `vscode-office-enhanced` 코드베이스를 가져온 뒤 public identity를 `code-office`으로 바꿔 가는 상태입니다. 현재 컨벤션은 “VS Code extension host 쪽 TypeScript + React WebView + Vditor resource bundle” 조합입니다.

## Language And Module Shape

Observed:

- extension host files use `.ts`
- React views use `.tsx`
- some bundled/vendor files use `.js`
- root build output is CommonJS through `tsconfig.json` and `build.ts`
- React build uses Vite and ES module style

Decision for future new source files:

- New extension-host logic should use `.ts`.
- New React views should use `.tsx`.
- New plain WebView helpers under `resource/vditor/` may stay `.js` because that area is already direct browser JavaScript.
- Do not convert existing CommonJS build wiring during feature phases unless there is a dedicated build-system phase.

## Naming

Original upstream identity:

- `vscode-office-enhanced`
- `Office Viewer Enhanced`

Current public identity:

- package name: `code-office`
- display name: `code-office`
- publisher: `jun6161`

Runtime identity split:

- public package, repository, Pages URL, HWP settings, and new owned commands use `code-office`
- most inherited `vscode-office.*` settings remain for Markdown, HTTP, and preview compatibility
- old `vscode-obsdian.hwp.*` values are read only as a legacy fallback
- `vscode-office.*` HTTP commands
- inherited `office.*` commands
- `cweijan.*` view types

Remaining migration proposal:

- migrate remaining settings to `code-office.*`
- migrate remaining commands to `code-office.*`
- migrate custom editor view types to `code-office.*`

The public repository spelling is `code-office`. Runtime prefix migration should stay separate because settings, command IDs, and custom editor associations are observable integration points.

Plan documents use numeric prefixes. Do not create bare `PLAN.md`, `plan.md`, `DIFF_PLAN.md`, `PHASES.md`, or `RCA.md`.

## Git And Repository State

Current import state:

- local working tree may still sit in a historical directory name during the rename
- cloned source: `https://github.com/rjwang1982/vscode-office`
- original upstream lineage: `https://github.com/cweijan/vscode-office`
- target `origin`: `https://github.com/lidge-jun/code-office.git`
- current `upstream`: `https://github.com/rjwang1982/vscode-office`
- package metadata points homepage/bugs/repository at the new repo, not upstream

Future new-repo step:

1. Preserve MIT license and original copyright notice.
2. Keep upstream lineage visible in README and NOTICE.
3. Treat runtime ID migration as a separate compatibility task.

## Verification Convention

Docs-only verification:

- `git status --short`
- `find structure devlog -type f`
- `node` JSON parse check when `package.json` changes
- build can be skipped for README/NOTICE-only edits, but package metadata changes should at least parse cleanly

Future code verification:

- `npm install` if dependencies are absent
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run verify:hwp`
- `node scripts/verify-vsix.mjs`
- `npm run package:verify` for VSIX content inspection
- `npm run release:local` before GitHub Release or Marketplace publish
- `npm audit --omit=dev` before release packaging
- targeted manual VS Code extension host smoke test
- WebView smoke for Markdown and binary previews

Release artifacts:

- Commit source/docs/scripts only.
- Do not commit `*.vsix`.
- Do not commit generated `resource/rhwp-studio/`.
- Do not commit dirty runtime sample files unless the sample change is the
  explicit task.
- GitHub Pages source lives under `docs/` and is excluded from VSIX packaging.
