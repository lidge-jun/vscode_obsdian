# vscode_obsdian Notice

`vscode_obsdian` is an independent VS Code extension. It contains source code,
runtime assets, and design patterns derived from several open source projects.
Each component remains subject to its own license terms.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Obsidian, Hancom, Microsoft,
cweijan/vscode-office, rjwang1982/vscode-office, or rhwp.

## Project Logo

The current `vscode_obsdian` logo in `images/logo-new.svg` and
`images/logo-new.png` was created for this repository on 2026-05-29. The design
started from an OpenAI image generation concept and was then manually simplified
into a project-owned SVG app icon.

The logo is not derived from the Obsidian app logo, VS Code logo, Microsoft
Office logo, Hancom logo, cweijan/vscode-office artwork, or rjwang1982/vscode-office
artwork. It intentionally replaces the previous green folder / "E" logo used by
the maintained vscode-office fork.

## Original Lineage

This repository contains code derived from MIT-licensed `vscode-office`
projects:

- `cweijan/vscode-office`, original project by Weijan Chen
- `rjwang1982/vscode-office`, maintained fork by RJ.Wang
